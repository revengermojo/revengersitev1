  <h1 class="big-neon">MISSION</h1>

  <section class="manifesto">
    <p>
      Our mission isn’t to chase the next exploit, or to hoard tools like trophies.  
      Our mission is to rebuild the culture of hacking itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The industry rewards shallow wins — CVEs filed without context,  
      bug reports written without insight, scanners run without understanding.  
      We exist to reverse that trend.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span>Understanding > Exploits</span> — Proof of insight over proof of concept.</li>
      <li><span>Builders First</span> — Code before copy-paste, creation before consumption.</li>
      <li><span>Systems Thinking</span> — We break to rebuild, not to boast.</li>
      <li><span>Collective Growth</span> — Knowledge shared, credit distributed, ego discarded.</li>
      <li><span>Adaptive Minds</span> — Tools fade; thinking endures. We craft both.</li>

    <p>
      We are not defined by the bugs we find.  
      We are defined by the depth of our analysis,  
      by the clarity of what we teach,  
      and by the systems we leave stronger than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to raise the standard of what it means to be a hacker.  
      To transform opportunists into craftsmen, followers into thinkers,  
      and noise into signal.
    </p>

    <p>
      RevengerMojo is not a shortcut.  
      It is the long road to mastery — and only those willing to walk it will endure.
